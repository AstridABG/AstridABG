## About me
I studied nutrition and specialized in Sports Nutrition, where I obtained a lot of satisfaction from meeting my patients' goals, but I am currently excited to embark on a new professional adventure now in the world of frontend development. I seek to merge my previous experience in patient management and care with my knowledge in web development to create innovative and user-centered digital experiences. My focus is to continue learning and growing in this field by providing a positive impact on people's lives through technology. I am studying in a bootcamp at [Laboratoria](https://www.laboratoria.la/) for web development.


## Featured Proyects

During my time within Laboratoria I carried out the following projects.

- [PokÃ©mex](https://astridabg.github.io/DEV009-data-lovers/src/). One of my favorites, because I will learn how to structure web pages using JS. It is an application to view pokemon data in the form of cards. When you click on the cards, a popUp is displayed with more extensive information about each pokemon. You can also filter them by name, type, weakness and strength.  [More info](https://github.com/AstridABG/DEV009-data-lovers).

- [Text Analyzer](https://astridabg.github.io/DEV009-text-analyzer/). This was my first project and where I learned how to do text analysis, as well as different uses of CSS to design the project's WEB. [More info](https://github.com/AstridABG/DEV009-text-analyzer).

- [Social Network](https://drawing-lovers.web.app/login). One of the most challenging projects was the first time I had to use an API for user registration and database management. This application is a social network that allows you to create an account, and access a wall where you can make posts, like them, edit them, and delete them. [More info](https://github.com/AstridABG/DEV009-social-network).

- [Markdown links analyzer](https://github.com/AstridABG/DEV009-md-links). Markdown link parser. It consists of a downloadable library with NMP for the analysis of folders with ".md" files. Extracts the links found and obtains the response code by using Axios, it also makes statistics with the links obtained. [More info](https://github.com/AstridABG/DEV009-md-links).
